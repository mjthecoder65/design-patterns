# Design-patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occuring problems
in software design. They are like pre-made blueprint that you can 
customize to solve a recuring design problem in your code.

You can't just a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can
with off-the-shelf function or libraries. The pattern is not a specific code,
but a general concept for solving particular problems.


# Why Design patterns?
1. Design patterns are toolkit of tried and tested solutions
to common problems in software design. Even if you never encouter these problems,
know patterns is still useful becuase it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems
using object oriented programming.

2. Design pattern define a common language that you and your teammates can use 
to communicate more efficiently. You  can say "oh just use singleton for that" and everython
will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what singleton is if you know
the pattern and its name.

# Classifications of design patterns
1. Creational patterns: Provide object creation mechanism that increase flexibility
and reuse of existing code.

2. Structural patterns: Explain how to assemble objects and classes into large structure
while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behaviral pattern: Take care of effective communication and assignment of responsibilities 
between objects.
